  cd ~/connective-crm-knowledge
  git pull origin main
  # Restart Claude Code if updates pulled
  ```

### During Automation Work (As needed)

### Weekly (5 minutes)

- [ ] Pull latest updates (even if no notification):
  ```bash
  cd ~/connective-crm-knowledge
  git pull
  ```

**Checkpoint:** ‚úÖ Integrated into daily workflow

- [ ] Test your changes
- [ ] Commit and push (or create issue)

**Checkpoint:** ‚úÖ Contributing to knowledge base

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Setup Issues

**Issue:** Git clone fails
- [ ] Check GitHub access (private repo requires invite)
- [ ] Try HTTPS instead of SSH: `git clone https://github.com/Larksa/connective-crm-knowledge.git`

**Issue:** Python version too old
- [ ] Check: `python3 --version` (need 3.8+)
- [ ] Install latest from https://python.org

**Issue:** MCP not showing in Claude Code
- [ ] Check `.claude.json` syntax (valid JSON)
- [ ] Use absolute path (not relative `./`)
- [ ] Restart Claude Code completely
- [ ] Test MCP starts manually first

**Issue:** "ModuleNotFoundError"
- [ ] Activate venv first
- [ ] Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Still stuck?**
- [ ] Check `TEAM_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting
- [ ] Ask team lead or colleague
- [ ] Create GitHub issue with error details
