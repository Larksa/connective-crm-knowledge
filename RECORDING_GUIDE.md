## üéØ Recording Types Explained

### Type 1: Workflow Recording ‚ö° (PRIORITY)

**Goal**: Capture ONE clean, perfect example from start to finish

**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

**Focus On**:
- ‚úÖ Navigation path (which tabs to click)
- ‚úÖ Field order (which fields to fill first)
- ‚úÖ Timing (wait for page loads, auto-save)
- ‚úÖ Common/typical values
- ‚úÖ Happy path only (no errors)

**Do NOT**:
- ‚ùå Test every dropdown option
- ‚ùå Fill optional fields
- ‚ùå Click extra buttons
- ‚ùå Test edge cases

**Example Session: "Add Liability Workflow"**
```
1. Click Financials tab ‚Üí wait 1s
2. Click Liabilities ‚Üí wait 2s
3. Click Add button ‚Üí wait 1s
4. Select "Credit Card" from liability type
5. Enter "Commonwealth Bank" in institution
6. Enter "Personal Card" in account name
7. Enter "5000" in balance
8. Enter "15000" in limit
9. Enter "250" in repayment
10. Select "Monthly" from frequency
11. Wait 2 seconds (auto-save)
12. DONE ‚úÖ
```

**Result**: Clean queryable workflow that can be added to MCP

---

### Type 2: Field Discovery Recording üîç (WHEN TIME PERMITS)

**Goal**: Test EVERYTHING - all fields, all options, all buttons

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes

**Focus On**:
- ‚úÖ Test ALL dropdown options (all 18 liability types)
- ‚úÖ Fill ALL fields (including optional ones)
- ‚úÖ Click ALL buttons (ownership, evidence, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Test conditional fields (vehicleType, ABN, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Try different values (long text, numbers, dates)
- ‚úÖ Observe validation (what's required? what's optional?)

**Do NOT**:
- ‚ùå Worry about speed
- ‚ùå Skip any options
- ‚ùå Ignore anonymous buttons

**Example Session: "Liabilities Field Discovery"**
```
1. Add liability #1: Test "Buy Now Pay Later"
   - Fill ALL fields (even optional BSB, account number)
   - Click ownership button (even if not needed)
   - Click evidence button
   - Test priority dropdown (all options)
   - Check "clearing from loan" checkbox

2. Add liability #2: Test "Car Loan"
   - Fill all fields again
   - Test different values

3. Continue through ALL 18 liability types...

4. Test edge cases:
   - Leave required fields empty (validation?)
   - Enter very long account name
   - Try negative balance
```

**Result**: Complete field metadata, all dropdown options verified, conditional fields discovered

---

### Type 3: Comprehensive Recording üì¶ (BEST OF BOTH)

**Goal**: Capture workflow AND thoroughly test fields in ONE session

**Duration**: 7-15 minutes

**Focus On**:
- ‚úÖ Start with clean workflow (first entry)
- ‚úÖ Then systematically test remaining options
- ‚úÖ Balance speed with thoroughness

**Structure**:
```
Part 1 (3 mins): Clean workflow
- One perfect example start to finish

Part 2 (7 mins): Field discovery
- Test remaining options
- Click all buttons
- Fill all fields
```

**Example Session: "Assets - Other Comprehensive"**
```
Part 1: Workflow (3 mins)
1. Navigate to Assets - Other
2. Add one "Boat" asset
3. Fill core fields (name, value, basis)
4. Complete and save

Part 2: Field Discovery (7 mins)
1. Add "Motor Vehicle" ‚Üí discover vehicleType field!
2. Test all 18 asset types
3. Test all value basis options
4. Test all vehicle types (if Motor Vehicle)
5. Click ownership button
6. Click evidence button
```

**Result**: Both queryable workflow AND complete field documentation

---

### Type 4: Edge Case Recording üéØ (AS DISCOVERED)

**Goal**: Document specific scenarios, conditional logic, or error states

**Duration**: 1-3 minutes

**Focus On**:
- ‚úÖ Specific trigger condition
- ‚úÖ What changes when condition is met
- ‚úÖ Validation errors
- ‚úÖ Conditional field appearance

**Examples**:

**"Motor Vehicle Conditional Field"**
```
1. Add asset
2. Select "Motor Vehicle"
3. ‚Üí vehicleType field appears!
4. Test all vehicle types
```

**"Dual Applicant Ownership"**
```
1. Add liability
2. Click ownership button
3. ‚Üí Allocation modal appears
4. Test "Allocate Evenly" vs "Custom"
```

**"Self-Employed ABN Field"**
```
1. Add employment
2. Select "Self-Employed"
3. ‚Üí ABN field appears!
4. Test ABN validation
```

**Result**: Edge case documentation added to relevant workflow/field docs

---

## üé¨ Recording Best Practices

### Before Recording

**1. Plan Your Approach**
- [ ] Decide: Workflow, Field Discovery, or Comprehensive?
- [ ] Know which section you're documenting
- [ ] Have test data ready (names, numbers, values)

**2. Prepare the CRM**
- [ ] Login to Connective CRM
- [ ] Navigate to relevant opportunity/application
- [ ] Clear any existing test data (fresh start)

**3. Start WorkflowCapture**
- [ ] Launch recording tool
- [ ] Give recording a descriptive name
- [ ] Add description noting the type and section

---

### During Recording

**For Workflows** (2-3 mins):
- [ ] Take your time - quality over speed
- [ ] Wait for page loads (don't rush)
- [ ] Use typical/common values
- [ ] Complete one perfect example
- [ ] Verify entry saved before stopping

**For Field Discovery** (5-10 mins):
- [ ] Be systematic - test options in order
- [ ] Click every button at least once
- [ ] Try different data types (text, numbers, dates)
- [ ] Note any validation messages
- [ ] Test optional vs required fields

**For Comprehensive** (7-15 mins):
- [ ] Start with clean workflow (first 3 mins)
- [ ] Then switch to field discovery mode
- [ ] Balance thoroughness with time

**For Edge Cases** (1-3 mins):
- [ ] Focus ONLY on the specific scenario
- [ ] Demonstrate the trigger condition
- [ ] Show what changes/appears
- [ ] Keep it short and focused

---

### After Recording

**1. Review the Recording**
- [ ] Playback to verify quality
- [ ] Check all interactions were captured
- [ ] Ensure no sensitive data visible

**2. Export the JSON**
- [ ] Save to appropriate location
- [ ] Use descriptive filename (e.g., `employment_workflow_2025-10-08.json`)

**3. Submit for Processing**
- [ ] Provide file path
- [ ] Label clearly: "Workflow recording for Employment"
- [ ] Mention any special notes or discoveries

---

## üìä Recommended Recording Priority

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (7-10 minutes total)
Record **workflow-focused sessions** for high-value sections:

**Priority 1** (Most valuable):
- [ ] Employment (2 mins)
- [ ] Real Estate Assets (3 mins)
- [ ] Details section (2 mins)

**Result**: 3 new queryable workflows

---

### Phase 2: Field Discovery (Later)
When you have more time, record **field discovery** for:

**Priority 2** (Complex sections):
- [ ] Employment (all types, conditional ABN field)
- [ ] Real Estate (all property types, conditional fields)
- [ ] Living Expenses (all 22 categories)

**Result**: Complete field metadata for remaining sections

---

### Phase 3: Edge Cases (As Discovered)
Record **edge cases** as you encounter them:

**Priority 3** (Document as found):
- [ ] Motor Vehicle conditional field
- [ ] Dual applicant workflows
- [ ] Self-employed ABN field
- [ ] Validation error states

**Result**: Edge case documentation

## üí° Tips for Great Recordings

### DO ‚úÖ

**Workflow Recordings**:
- ‚úÖ Use common, realistic values
- ‚úÖ Wait for page loads and auto-saves
- ‚úÖ Follow natural user flow

---

### DON'T ‚ùå

**Workflow Recordings**:
- ‚ùå Test every option (save for field discovery)

**Label clearly** when submitting:
- "Workflow recording for [section]"
- "Field discovery for [section]"
- "Comprehensive recording for [section]"
- "[Scenario] edge case for [section]"

**Start with workflows** (quick wins), add field discovery later when you have time!

---

**Questions?** Just say:
- "I have a workflow recording for X" ‚Üí I'll extract workflow
- "I have field discovery for X" ‚Üí I'll extract all fields
- "I have a comprehensive recording for X" ‚Üí I'll extract both
- "I have [scenario] edge case" ‚Üí I'll document the edge case

Happy recording! üé¨
