# Queryable Workflows Added to MCP - Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Workflows Added**: 4 new workflows (7 total)

---

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Added 4 Queryable Workflows to MCP

Converted detailed section workflows from documentation into **structured, queryable workflows** that the MCP server can return to AI assistants.

**New Workflows**:
1. **add_liability** - 14 steps (Liabilities section)
2. **add_asset_other** - 8 steps (Assets-Other section)
3. **add_living_expense** - 6 steps (Living Expenses section)
4. **add_other_income** - 6 steps (Other Income section)

**Total Available**: 7 workflows (3 original + 4 new)

---

## Before vs After

### **Before This Work**

**MCP could query**: 3 basic workflows
```python
crm.get_workflow("add_note")  # ✅
crm.get_workflow("upload_file")  # ✅
crm.get_workflow("complete_questionnaire")  # ✅
crm.get_workflow("add_liability")  # ❌ Not available
```

**Workflow knowledge existed** in section docs (liabilities.md, assets_other.md, etc.) but:
- Was locked in code examples (Python functions)
- NOT queryable via MCP
- AI had to read entire markdown files to find workflows
- No structured format for timing, conditional logic, etc.

---

### **After This Work**

**MCP can query**: 7 workflows including all major sections
```python
crm.get_workflow("add_note")  # ✅
crm.get_workflow("upload_file")  # ✅
crm.get_workflow("complete_questionnaire")  # ✅
crm.get_workflow("add_liability")  # ✅ NEW
crm.get_workflow("add_asset_other")  # ✅ NEW
crm.get_workflow("add_living_expense")  # ✅ NEW
crm.get_workflow("add_other_income")  # ✅ NEW
```

**Workflow knowledge is now**:
- ✅ Structured as queryable Workflow objects
- ✅ Includes critical timing (79s page load, 2s auto-save)
- ✅ Documents conditional fields (vehicleType only for Motor Vehicle)
- ✅ Warns about selector stability (use [data-testid="Add"], NOT #btn_{UUID})
- ✅ Verified from actual recordings (jlall.json, other_income recording)

---

## What Each Workflow Contains

### 1. add_liability (14 steps)

**Source**: liabilities.md + jlall.json recording
**Section**: Financials → Liabilities

**Key Features**:
- ✅ All 13 fields documented (including NEW priority field)
- ✅ Critical timing: 79s max page load, 2s auto-save
- ✅ Optional fields clearly marked (BSB, Account Number, Priority)
- ✅ Checkbox handling (accountClearingFromLoan)
- ✅ Frequency values (lowercase: "annually", "monthly", etc.)

**Selectors Verified**:
- [data-testid="Add"] - stable
- #name, #institution, #accountName, #value, #limit, #accountRepayment
- #accountRepaymentFrequency, #priority
- [name="accountClearingFromLoan"] - checkbox

**Example Query**:
```python
wf = crm.get_workflow("add_liability")
print(f"{wf.title}: {len(wf.steps)} steps")
# Output: "Add Liability Entry: 14 steps"
```

---

### 2. add_asset_other (8 steps)

**Source**: assets_other.md + jlall.json recording
**Section**: Financials → Assets - Other

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Conditional field handling (vehicleType only for Motor Vehicle)
- ✅ Index-based asset-type pattern (asset-type-0, asset-type-1, etc.)
- ✅ Selector stability: EXCELLENT rating
- ✅ Both standard asset and motor vehicle examples

**Selectors Verified**:
- [data-testid="Add"] - stable
- [data-testid="asset-type-{index}"] - INDEX-based (NOT UUID)
- #name, #value, #valueBasis (confirmed stable from recording)
- #vehicleType (conditional)

**Critical Notes**:
- **Pattern**: asset-type-0 for first asset, asset-type-1 for second (zero-indexed)
- **Not UUID-based**: Most stable section in CRM!

---

### 3. add_living_expense (6 steps)

**Source**: living_expenses.md + jlall.json recording
**Section**: Financials → Living Expenses

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Shared selectors with Other Income (#frequency, #amount)
- ✅ Universal pattern across all 22 expense categories
- ✅ Auto-save after amount entry (no submit button)
- ✅ Category selector varies by expense type

**Selectors Verified**:
- [data-testid="Add"] - stable
- #frequency (shared with Other Income)
- #amount (shared with Other Income)
- Category selector: varies (see living_expenses.md)

**Critical Finding**:
Living Expenses and Other Income use **identical field selectors** for frequency and amount!

---

### 4. add_other_income (6 steps)

**Source**: other_income_COMPLETE_FIELDS.md + recording
**Section**: Financials → Other Income

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Simplest workflow (only 3 form fields)
- ✅ All 4 income types verified (Dividends, Family Allowance, Maintenance, Other)
- ✅ Selector stability warnings (use #type, NOT data-testid with UUID)
- ✅ Auto-save after amount (2s delay)

**Selectors Verified**:
- [data-testid="Add"] - stable (NOT #btn_{UUID})
- #type (stable - NOT data-testid="income-type-{UUID}")
- #frequency (shared with Living Expenses)
- #amount (shared with Living Expenses)

---

## Critical Insights Included in Workflows

### 1. Timing Requirements (from recordings)

**add_liability workflow includes**:
```
Critical Timing Requirements:
- Page load timeout: 79 seconds (from recording)
- Auto-save delay: 2 seconds after final field
- Field transition: 0.5-1 second between actions
```

**Why this matters**: AI won't timeout on slow page loads or miss auto-save delays.

---

### 2. Selector Stability Warnings

**add_other_income workflow warns**:
```
Critical Notes:
- Use #type selector, NOT data-testid (contains UUID)
- [data-testid="Add"] is stable for Add button
```

**Why this matters**: Prevents automation breakage from UUID-based selectors.

---

### 3. Conditional Fields

**add_asset_other workflow documents**:
```
8. Select Vehicle Type (Conditional)
   - Selector: #vehicleType
   - Action: Select from dropdown (ONLY if asset type = "Motor Vehicle")
   - Note: Field only appears for Motor Vehicle assets
```

**Why this matters**: AI knows when to expect fields vs when they're conditional.

---

### 4. Verification Evidence

**Each workflow includes**:
```
Verified: Index-based pattern from jlall.json recording
Verified: Selector confirmed stable from jlall.json recording
```

**Why this matters**: Confidence that selectors work in production CRM.

---

## How AI Can Use These Workflows

### **Scenario 1: Building Custom Automation**

AI can query workflow to understand the pattern, then adapt:

```python
# AI queries the workflow
wf = crm.get_workflow("add_liability")

# AI learns:
# - Navigation path: #financials → #liabilities
# - Add button: [data-testid="Add"]
# - All 14 field selectors
# - Critical timing: 79s page load, 2s auto-save
# - Optional fields: BSB, accountNumber, priority

# AI builds custom automation using this knowledge
def add_multiple_liabilities(liabilities_list):
    for liability in liabilities_list:
        # Use workflow pattern but adapt for bulk entry
        ...
```

---

### **Scenario 2: Using Proven Pattern Directly**

AI can execute workflow as-is for standard use cases:

```python
# AI retrieves proven workflow
wf = crm.get_workflow("add_other_income")

# AI executes each step exactly as documented
for step in wf.steps:
    execute_step(step.selector, step.action)
    wait(step.wait_ms or inferred_wait_from_notes)
```

---

### **Scenario 3: Learning Field Relationships**

AI can discover shared patterns across workflows:

```python
# AI queries both workflows
living_exp = crm.get_workflow("add_living_expense")
other_income = crm.get_workflow("add_other_income")

# AI discovers they share selectors:
# - Both use #frequency
# - Both use #amount
# - Both have 2s auto-save delay

# AI can reuse code between these sections!
```

---

## Usage Examples

### **For Claude Code (MCP Client)**

```python
# Claude Code can now ask:
"What's the workflow for adding a liability?"

# MCP returns structured workflow:
crm.get_workflow("add_liability")
→ 14 steps with selectors, actions, timing

# Claude Code can then:
# 1. Show user the workflow
# 2. Execute it step-by-step
# 3. Adapt it for bulk operations
# 4. Learn timing requirements
```

---

### **For SDK Users**

```python
from sdk import CRMReference

crm = CRMReference()

# List all available workflows
workflows = crm.list_workflows()
print(workflows)
# → ['add_note', 'upload_file', 'complete_questionnaire',
#    'add_liability', 'add_asset_other', 'add_living_expense', 'add_other_income']

# Get specific workflow
wf = crm.get_workflow("add_liability")
print(f"{wf.title}: {len(wf.steps)} steps")
# → "Add Liability Entry: 14 steps"

# Iterate through steps
for step in wf.steps:
    print(f"Step {step.number}: {step.description}")
    print(f"  Selector: {step.selector}")
    print(f"  Action: {step.action}")
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Structured > Embedded
Converting code examples to structured workflows makes knowledge **queryable** instead of just **readable**.

### 2. Timing is Critical
79-second page load timeout and 2-second auto-save delays can't be inferred - they **must** be documented in workflows.

### 3. Selector Stability Matters
UUID warnings in workflows prevent future automation breakage. Example: [data-testid="Add"] vs #btn_{UUID}.

### 4. Recording Verification is Valuable
Being able to say "Verified from jlall.json recording" gives confidence selectors work in production.

### 5. Shared Patterns are Powerful
Discovering that Living Expenses and Other Income share #frequency and #amount selectors enables code reuse.
