# Scaling Knowledge Extraction to Other Applications - Strategic Planning

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Planning / Decision Pending
**Purpose**: Evaluate options for applying the Connective CRM knowledge extraction system to other browser-based applications

---

## Executive Summary

You've built a **4-layer knowledge extraction & querying system** that is **application-agnostic** and can be reused for ANY browser-based application:

**External Input**: WorkflowCapture (separate project) → JSON recordings of browser interactions

**Your System**:
1. **Extraction Layer** → Python scripts that convert JSON → Markdown
2. **Knowledge Layer** → Structured markdown documentation
3. **SDK Layer** → Parses markdown into queryable Python objects
4. **MCP Layer** → Exposes knowledge to AI assistants

**The opportunity**: All layers work for ANY web app - you can scale this to all your applications!

**Key Insight**: The recording tool is decoupled from your system. Any tool that outputs similar JSON (browser interactions with selectors and timing) can feed into your extraction pipeline.

**Three main options**:
- **Option 1**: Separate repository per application (2-4 apps)
- **Option 2**: Multi-application monorepo (5-8 apps)
- **Option 3**: Template framework (8+ apps or team-wide)

## What You've Actually Built

### The Transferable System

**External Dependency (Separate Project)**:

**Recording Tool**: WorkflowCapture (or any similar tool)
- Output: JSON files with browser interactions (selectors, actions, timing)
- **Application-agnostic**: Works for any web app
- **Your system accepts this JSON as input**
- **Decoupled**: Any recording tool that produces similar JSON structure can work

---

**Your 4-Layer Knowledge Extraction System**:

**Layer 1: Extraction**
- Tools: `extract_all_fields_from_recording.py`, comparison scripts
- Input: JSON recordings (from WorkflowCapture or similar)
- Output: Structured markdown with field metadata
- **Application-agnostic**: Works for any JSON recording with browser interactions
- **100% reusable**: These scripts work for ANY web app

**Layer 2: Knowledge**
- Format: Structured markdown files
- Content: Workflows, field selectors, dropdown options
- Structure: COMPLETE_[APP]_REFERENCE.md + section files
- **80% reusable**: Format is universal, content is app-specific

**Layer 3: SDK**
- Code: Python SDK that parses markdown
- Functions: Query selectors, validate dropdowns, fuzzy matching
- **70% reusable**: Core logic is generic, parsing needs customization

**Layer 4: MCP**
- Server: Exposes SDK as MCP tools
- Integration: Claude Code can query via MCP
- **90% reusable**: Tool structure is generic, just rename

### What Makes This Valuable

**You didn't just document Connective CRM.**

You created:
- ✅ A recording methodology (Workflow vs Field Discovery) - to guide external recording tool usage
- ✅ An extraction system (JSON → Markdown) - **100% reusable for any web app**
- ✅ A documentation format (structured, queryable) - **80% reusable**
- ✅ A knowledge structure (Elements, Workflows, Fields) - **80% reusable**
- ✅ An AI integration pattern (MCP server) - **90% reusable**

**This saves 80% of effort for every future application you document!**

**Even better**: Since your system only depends on JSON input (not the recording tool), you could:
- Use different recording tools for different apps
- Upgrade to a better recording tool later
- Accept recordings from team members using various tools
- Write custom scripts to generate the JSON format

## Three Strategic Options

### Option 1: Separate Repository Per Application ✅ RECOMMENDED FOR 2-4 APPS

**Structure**:
```
connective-crm-knowledge/       (existing)
salesforce-knowledge/           (new)
xero-accounting-knowledge/      (new)
hubspot-crm-knowledge/          (new)
```

**Each repository contains**:
```
[app]-knowledge/
├── knowledge/
│   ├── COMPLETE_[APP]_REFERENCE.md
│   ├── sections/
│   │   ├── section1.md
│   │   ├── section2.md
│   │   └── section3.md
│   └── mappings/
├── sdk/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── reference_loader.py
│   ├── query_engine.py
│   └── fuzzy_matcher.py
├── mcp_server/
│   └── [app]_server.py
├── tools/
│   ├── extract_all_fields_from_recording.py
│   ├── analyze_recording_sections.py
│   ├── compare_extracted_with_docs.py
│   └── list_recordings.py
├── RECORDING_GUIDE.md
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

**MCP Configuration** (separate servers):
```json
// .claude/config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "connective-crm": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/connective-crm-knowledge/mcp_server/connective_crm_server.py"]
    },
    "salesforce": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/salesforce-knowledge/mcp_server/salesforce_server.py"]
    },
    "xero": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/xero-knowledge/mcp_server/xero_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Clean separation (Connective changes don't affect Salesforce)
- ✅ Each app has its own MCP server
- ✅ Easy to share specific app knowledge with team members
- ✅ Can archive/delete unused apps without affecting others
- ✅ Different team members can own different apps
- ✅ Simple to understand and maintain

- ✅ Can evolve each app independently

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Some code duplication (SDK, tools copied to each repo)
- ⚠️ Need to maintain multiple repositories
- ⚠️ Bug fixes need to be applied to each repo manually
- ⚠️ Harder to compare patterns across apps
- ⚠️ More repos to clone for full team access

**Best For**:
- 2-4 applications
- Small team (1-3 people)
- Different people own different apps
- Apps have very different structures
- Want maximum isolation and simplicity

**Setup Time Per App**: 2-3 hours

### Option 2: Multi-Application Monorepo

**Structure**:
```
automation-knowledge/
├── apps/
│   ├── connective-crm/
│   │   ├── knowledge/
│   │   │   ├── COMPLETE_CONNECTIVE_CRM_REFERENCE.md
│   │   │   └── sections/

│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── models.py
│   │   ├── reference_loader.py
│   │   ├── query_engine.py
│   │   └── fuzzy_matcher.py
│   ├── tools/            ← Shared extraction scripts

│       ├── RECORDING_GUIDE.md.template
│       └── section_template.md
├── RECORDING_GUIDE.md    ← Universal guide
└── README.md
```

**MCP Configuration** (unified server with routing):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "automation-knowledge": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/automation-knowledge/mcp_server/unified_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "APPS_DIR": "C:/path/to/automation-knowledge/apps"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or multiple servers from one repo:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "connective-crm": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/automation-knowledge/apps/connective-crm/mcp_server/connective_crm_server.py"]
    },
    "salesforce": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/automation-knowledge/apps/salesforce/mcp_server/salesforce_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ No code duplication (shared SDK/tools)
- ✅ One place to maintain everything
- ✅ Bug fixes apply to all apps automatically
- ✅ Can compare patterns across apps easily
- ✅ Unified documentation approach
- ✅ Single clone for entire team
- ✅ Easier to see "big picture"

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Larger repository (slower cloning)
- ⚠️ Changes to shared code affect all apps
- ⚠️ Need careful testing when updating shared components
- ⚠️ More complex structure to navigate
- ⚠️ Tighter coupling between apps

**Best For**:
- 4-8 applications
- Medium team (3-5 people)
- Same team managing all apps
- Want consistency across apps
- Apps have similar structures
- Willing to invest in initial setup

**Setup Time**: 8-12 hours initial monorepo structure, then 1-2 hours per app

---

### Option 3: Framework/Template Approach 🌟 BEST LONG-TERM

**Structure**:
```
web-app-knowledge-template/     ← The "framework" repository
├── templates/
│   ├── knowledge/
│   │   ├── COMPLETE_{{APP_NAME}}_REFERENCE.md.template
│   │   └── sections/
│   │       └── section_template.md
│   ├── sdk/              ← Generic SDK code
│   ├── mcp_server/       ← Generic MCP server template
│   ├── tools/            ← Generic extraction scripts
│   └── RECORDING_GUIDE.md.template
├── setup/
│   ├── setup.py          ← Setup script
│   └── config.yaml       ← Configuration template
├── examples/
│   ├── connective-crm/   ← Working example
│   └── salesforce/       ← Working example
├── docs/
│   ├── SETUP_GUIDE.md
│   ├── CUSTOMIZATION_GUIDE.md
│   └── ARCHITECTURE.md
└── README.md
```

**How someone creates a new app**:
```bash
# Clone the template
git clone https://github.com/yourcompany/web-app-knowledge-template salesforce-knowledge

# Run setup wizard
cd salesforce-knowledge
python setup.py

# Interactive prompts:
> Application name: Salesforce
> Application type: CRM
> Main sections (comma-separated): Leads,Opportunities,Accounts,Contacts
> Recording tool path: C:\WorkflowCapture\recordings

# Generates:
✓ COMPLETE_SALESFORCE_REFERENCE.md
✓ knowledge/sections/leads.md (template)
✓ knowledge/sections/opportunities.md (template)
✓ knowledge/sections/accounts.md (template)
✓ knowledge/sections/contacts.md (template)
✓ mcp_server/salesforce_server.py (customized)
✓ RECORDING_GUIDE.md (customized with Salesforce sections)
✓ README.md (customized)
✓ .gitignore

# Ready to use in 5 minutes!
```

**Setup Script Features**:
```python
# setup.py capabilities:
- Replace {{APP_NAME}} with actual app name
- Generate section template files
- Customize MCP server with app name
- Create app-specific recording guide
- Generate README with app-specific examples

- ✅ Documentation templates included

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Initial setup time to create template system (20-30 hours)
- ⚠️ Need to update existing apps when template improves
- ⚠️ More abstraction to understand
- ⚠️ Requires maintaining template repository

**Best For**:
- 8+ applications
- Team-wide adoption (5+ people)
- Different people documenting different apps
- Want extremely fast onboarding
- Planning long-term scaling
- Have technical person to build initial framework

**Setup Time**: 20-30 hours to build framework, then 5-10 minutes per new app

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | Separate Repos (Option 1) | Monorepo (Option 2) | Template Framework (Option 3) |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Number of apps** | 2-3 apps | 4-8 apps | 8+ apps or team-wide |
| **Team size** | 1-2 people | 2-5 people | 5+ people or multiple teams |
| **Maintenance** | Simple per app | Moderate centralized | Simple per app |
| **Consistency** | Manual enforcement | Enforced by structure | Enforced by template |
| **Setup time per app** | 2-3 hours | 1-2 hours | 5-10 minutes |
| **Initial setup** | None | 8-12 hours | 20-30 hours |
| **Code duplication** | High | None | Low |
| **Isolation** | Excellent | Good | Excellent |
| **Learning curve** | Low | Medium | Low (after template exists) |
| **Bug fix propagation** | Manual | Automatic | Manual but template helps |
| **Flexibility** | High | Medium | High |
| **Scalability** | Limited (manual work) | Good | Excellent |

## What to Reuse vs Customize

### 100% Reusable (Copy as-is)

**Tools**:
- ✅ `extract_all_fields_from_recording.py` - Generic field extractor
- ✅ `analyze_recording_sections.py` - Generic section analyzer
- ✅ `list_recordings.py` - Generic recording lister
- ✅ `compare_extracted_with_docs.py` - Generic comparison tool
- ✅ Recording methodology (Workflow vs Field Discovery) - guide for using external recording tools

**Why**: These tools work on any JSON recording format from WorkflowCapture or similar browser recording tools. The JSON structure (selectors, actions, timing) is fairly standard across recording tools.

**SDK Core Concepts**:
- ✅ `models.py` base classes (Element, Workflow, WorkflowStep)
- ✅ Fuzzy matching logic (works for any dropdown)
- ✅ Query engine pattern (get_selector, validate_dropdown, etc.)

**Why**: These are application-agnostic patterns

**Process & Methodology**:
- ✅ [External Recording Tool] → Extraction → Documentation → SDK → MCP flow
- ✅ Workflow vs Field Discovery approach (methodology for guiding recording sessions)
- ✅ Supplemental documentation strategy
- ✅ NEW vs VERIFIED vs ENHANCED categorization

**Why**: This workflow applies to any application. The recording tool is external, but your methodology for what to record and how to structure it is highly reusable.

---

### 80% Reusable (Minor tweaks needed)

**Documentation Structure**:
- 📝 COMPLETE_[APP]_REFERENCE.md format
  - Change: Application name, sections, terminology
  - Keep: Structure, workflow format, field metadata format

- 📝 Section documentation format (liabilities.md → leads.md)
  - Change: Section name, fields, workflows
  - Keep: Format, headings, metadata structure

- 📝 Workflow documentation format
  - Change: App-specific steps, selectors, timing
  - Keep: Step structure, selector format, example code format

**Why**: Format is universal, content is app-specific

**MCP Server**:
- 📝 Tool definitions (get_selector, validate_dropdown, fuzzy_match, get_workflow)
- 📝 Server structure (list_tools, call_tool pattern)
- 📝 Error handling patterns

**Changes needed**:
- Application name in descriptions
- App-specific error messages
- Tool parameter descriptions

**Why**: Structure is universal, descriptions are app-specific

---

### 50% Reusable (Significant customization)

**SDK Parsing Logic** (`reference_loader.py`):
- 📝 Markdown parsing approach (can reuse)
- 📝 Workflow extraction pattern (may need adjustment)
- 📝 Element extraction pattern (needs customization)

**Changes needed**:
- Each app may have different element types
  - Connective: `#selector`, `[data-testid="..."]`
  - Salesforce: `[data-selenium-id="..."]`, `lightning-input`
  - Xero: Different selector patterns

- Different field metadata structures
  - Some apps have more/fewer attributes
  - Different validation patterns
  - Different conditional logic

- App-specific validation rules
  - Date formats
  - Currency formats
  - Field constraints

**Why**: Core logic is reusable but needs app-specific adaptations

**Example - Selector Parsing**:
```python
# Connective CRM
selector = "#accountName"
data_testid = '[data-testid="Add"]'

# Salesforce
selector = '[data-selenium-id="accountName"]'
lightning_input = 'lightning-input[field-name="AccountName"]'

# Xero
selector = '[data-automationid="accountName"]'
```

Different apps use different patterns - parser needs customization

---

### App-Specific (Write from scratch)

**Knowledge Content**:
- ❌ Actual workflows (unique per app)
- ❌ Field lists (unique per app)
- ❌ Dropdown options (unique per app)
- ❌ Section structures (unique per app)
- ❌ Navigation patterns (unique per app)

**Why**: This is the actual knowledge - must be recorded and extracted

**App-Specific Customizations**:
- ❌ Custom validation logic (app-specific business rules)
- ❌ App-specific field types (custom controls)
- ❌ Special workflows (unique to that app)
- ❌ Integration-specific features

**Why**: These are application-specific requirements

---

## Implementation Guide

### For Your Next Application (Example: Salesforce)

**Total Time Estimate**: 2.5 hours

---

#### Step 1: Copy Repository Structure (30 mins)

**Actions**:
```bash
# 1. Copy the entire directory
cp -r connective-crm-knowledge salesforce-knowledge
cd salesforce-knowledge

# 2. Initialize new git repo
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin <your-salesforce-knowledge-repo-url>

# 3. Update .gitignore (no changes needed)
```

**Files to keep as-is**:
- ✅ All of `tools/` directory
- ✅ All of `sdk/` directory structure
- ✅ `mcp_server/` structure
- ✅ `.gitignore`

**Files to clear**:
- ❌ `knowledge/COMPLETE_CONNECTIVE_CRM_REFERENCE.md` → Clear content
- ❌ All files in `knowledge/sections/` → Delete
- ❌ All files in `knowledge/mappings/` → Delete (will regenerate)

---

#### Step 2: Customize Core Files (1 hour)

**File 1: README.md**
```markdown
# Salesforce Knowledge Base

MCP-enabled knowledge base for Salesforce automation.

## Sections Documented
- Leads
- Opportunities
- Accounts
- Contacts

## Workflows Available
- add_lead (6 steps)
- add_opportunity (8 steps)

## MCP Integration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "salesforce": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/salesforce-knowledge/mcp_server/salesforce_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```
```

**File 2: RECORDING_GUIDE.md**
- Replace all "Liabilities", "Assets", "Financials" with "Leads", "Opportunities", "Sales Cloud"
- Update section examples
- Adjust terminology (CRM → Salesforce, etc.)

**File 3: knowledge/COMPLETE_SALESFORCE_REFERENCE.md**
```markdown
# Complete Salesforce Reference

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-08
**Total Elements**: 0 (to be documented)
**Total Workflows**: 0 (to be documented)

## Sections

### Sales Cloud
- Leads
- Opportunities
- Accounts
- Contacts

## Elements

[To be populated as recordings are processed]

## Validated Workflows

[To be populated as workflows are extracted]
```

**File 4: mcp_server/salesforce_server.py**
- Rename from `connective_crm_server.py`
- Replace all instances of "Connective CRM" with "Salesforce"
- Update import: `from sdk import SalesforceReference`
- Update tool descriptions

**File 5: sdk/__init__.py**
```python
# Change import name
from .reference_loader import ReferenceLoader as SalesforceReference
from .models import Element, Workflow, WorkflowStep
```

---

#### Step 3: Create Section Templates (10 mins)

**Create blank section files**:
```bash
cd knowledge/sections
touch leads.md
touch opportunities.md
touch accounts.md
touch contacts.md
```

**Template for each** (example: leads.md):
```markdown
# Leads - Detailed Automation Guide

> **Parent Reference**: [COMPLETE_SALESFORCE_REFERENCE.md](../COMPLETE_SALESFORCE_REFERENCE.md)
> **Section**: Sales Cloud → Leads
> **Last Updated**: 2025-10-08

```

---

#### Step 4: Record First Workflow (30 mins)

**Note**: Use WorkflowCapture or your preferred browser recording tool to capture this workflow as JSON.

**Recording Session**: "Workflow recording for Leads"

**What to do**:
```
Duration: 3 minutes

1. Start at Salesforce dashboard
2. Navigate to Sales Cloud → Leads
3. Click "New" button
4. Fill form fields:
   - Last Name: "Smith"
   - Company: "Acme Corp"
   - Email: "john.smith@acme.com"
   - Phone: "555-0123"
   - Status: "Open - Not Contacted"
5. Click "Save"
6. Wait for save confirmation
7. Stop recording
```

**Save recording**: `salesforce_leads_workflow_2025-10-08.json`

---

#### Step 5: Extract Fields (5 mins)

**Run extraction**:
```bash
cd tools
python extract_all_fields_from_recording.py ../recordings/salesforce_leads_workflow.json
```

**Output**:
```
knowledge/sections/leads_extracted_fields.md
```

**Review**:
- Check field selectors look correct
- Verify timing is captured
- Note any data-selenium-id or lightning-input patterns

---

#### Step 6: Create Queryable Workflow (20 mins)

**Add to COMPLETE_SALESFORCE_REFERENCE.md**:
```markdown
## Validated Workflows

### Workflow 1: Add Lead

**Status**: Validated
**Triggers Modal**: No
**Auto-Save**: Yes
**Section**: Sales Cloud → Leads

**Steps**:

1. **Navigate to Leads**
   - Selector: `[data-tab-name="Leads"]`
   - Action: Click
   - Wait: 2000ms

2. **Click New Button**
   - Selector: `[data-aura-class="forceActionLink"]`
   - Action: Click
   - Wait: 1000ms

3. **Enter Last Name**
   - Selector: `[data-selenium-id="LastName"]`
   - Action: Clear and type text
   - Wait: 500ms

4. **Enter Company**
   - Selector: `[data-selenium-id="Company"]`
   - Action: Clear and type text
   - Wait: 500ms

5. **Enter Email**
   - Selector: `[data-selenium-id="Email"]`
   - Action: Clear and type text
   - Wait: 500ms

6. **Select Status**
   - Selector: `[data-selenium-id="Status"]`
   - Action: Select from dropdown
   - Wait: 500ms

7. **Click Save**
   - Selector: `[data-aura-class="forceActionButton"]`
   - Action: Click
   - Wait: 2000ms for save

**Complete Example**:
```python
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import time

# Step 1-2: Navigate and open form
driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, '[data-tab-name="Leads"]').click()
time.sleep(2)
driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, '[data-aura-class="forceActionLink"]').click()
time.sleep(1)

# Step 3-6: Fill fields
driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, '[data-selenium-id="LastName"]').send_keys("Smith")
time.sleep(0.5)
driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, '[data-selenium-id="Company"]').send_keys("Acme Corp")
time.sleep(0.5)
driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, '[data-selenium-id="Email"]').send_keys("john.smith@acme.com")
time.sleep(0.5)

# Step 7: Save
driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, '[data-aura-class="forceActionButton"]').click()
time.sleep(2)
```
\```

**Update metadata**:
```markdown
**Total Elements**: 7
**Total Workflows**: 1
```

---

#### Step 7: Update SDK Parser (10 mins)

**Ensure workflow will be parsed**:

Check `sdk/reference_loader.py`:
```python
workflows_to_parse = [
    ("add_lead", "Add Lead"),  # Add this
    # ... other workflows
]
```

**Test parsing**:
```bash
python -c "from sdk import SalesforceReference; sf = SalesforceReference(); print(sf.list_workflows())"
# Should output: ['add_lead']
```

---

#### Step 8: Test MCP Integration (20 mins)

**Add to Claude Code config**:
```json
// ~/.claude/config.json or project .claude/config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "connective-crm": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/connective-crm-knowledge/mcp_server/connective_crm_server.py"]
    },
    "salesforce": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/salesforce-knowledge/mcp_server/salesforce_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Restart Claude Code**

**Test queries**:
```
In Claude Code:
"What workflows are available in Salesforce?"
→ Should return: add_lead

"Show me the workflow for adding a lead in Salesforce"
→ Should return: 7-step workflow

"What's the selector for the Last Name field in Salesforce?"
→ Should return: [data-selenium-id="LastName"]
```

---

#### Step 9: Commit Initial Setup (5 mins)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Salesforce knowledge base setup

- Configured for Salesforce
- Added Leads section
- Documented add_lead workflow (7 steps)
- MCP integration ready
"
git push origin main
```

---

### Result After 2.5 Hours

**You now have**:
- ✅ Working Salesforce knowledge base
- ✅ One documented section (Leads)
- ✅ One queryable workflow (add_lead)
- ✅ MCP integration working
- ✅ Template for adding more sections
- ✅ Proof that pattern is reusable

**Next steps** (incremental):
- Record Opportunities workflow (3 mins)
- Record Accounts workflow (3 mins)
- Record Contacts workflow (3 mins)
- Each takes ~30 mins to extract and document

---

## Cost/Benefit Analysis

### Option 1: Separate Repos

**Initial Setup**: 2-3 hours per app
**Maintenance**: ~30 mins per month per app
**Bug fixes**: Manual propagation to each repo

**Costs**:
- Time: 2-3 hours × number of apps
- Maintenance: Duplicated effort across repos
- Bug fixes: Must apply to each repo

**Benefits**:
- Simple to understand
- Easy to share individual apps
- Maximum isolation
- No dependencies
- Can delete unused apps easily

**ROI**:
- High for 2-4 apps
- Decreases as you add more apps (duplication becomes burden)

## Specific Recommendations

### For Your Situation

Based on typical progression, here's what I recommend:

---

### Phase 1: Prove the Pattern (Month 1)

**Goal**: Validate that system works for different applications

**Action**: Create ONE additional application using **Option 1 (Separate Repo)**

**Recommended app**: Your #2 most-used application (likely Salesforce, Xero, or HubSpot)

**Why separate repo**:
- ✅ Fastest to get started (2-3 hours)
- ✅ Low commitment
- ✅ Proves pattern is reusable
- ✅ Learn what's different vs Connective

**Steps**:
1. Copy `connective-crm-knowledge` → `[app]-knowledge`
2. Customize for new app (use guide above)
3. Document 2-3 key sections
4. Validate workflows are queryable

**Time**: 3-4 hours total

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Can query workflows via MCP
- ✅ Can extract fields from recordings
- ✅ Documentation format works for new app
- ✅ Identified what needs customization

**Outcome**: Proof that pattern is reusable

---

### Phase 2: Optimize (Months 2-3)

**Goal**: Reduce duplication and document learnings

**Action**: Document 2nd application, start optimization

**Steps**:
1. Create 3rd application (separate repo)
2. Compare what's same vs different between all apps
3. Extract truly generic tools into `shared-tools/` folder
4. Document the differences in a guide
5. Create simple setup checklist

**Time**: 2-3 hours

**What to extract**:
- Common extraction scripts → `shared-tools/`
- Common SDK patterns → Document
- Common MCP patterns → Document
- Setup checklist → Standardize

**Outcome**: Faster to add 4th application (30% time reduction)

---

### Phase 3: Scale Decision (Month 4+)

**Goal**: Choose long-term strategy based on actual usage

**Decision point**: How many apps do you actually want to document?

**If 2-4 apps**:
→ **Stick with Option 1 (Separate Repos)**
- ✅ Already working
- ✅ Simple and maintainable
- ✅ No need to over-engineer
- Action: Continue current approach

**If 5-8 apps**:
→ **Consider Option 2 (Monorepo)**
- ✅ Reduces duplication
- ✅ Easier maintenance
- ✅ Worth the 8-12 hour investment
- Action: Create monorepo, migrate existing apps over time

**If 8+ apps or team-wide adoption**:
→ **Build Option 3 (Template Framework)**
- ✅ Huge time savings long-term
- ✅ Enables team scaling
- ✅ Worth the 20-30 hour investment
- Action: Build framework, migrate existing apps

---

→ Any option works

**Yes - want easy onboarding**
→ Option 3 (Template framework)
- Lowest barrier to entry
- Non-technical can set up apps
- Built-in guidance
- Consistent structure

**Yes - but technical team**
→ Option 2 (Monorepo)
- Can handle complexity
- Benefit from shared code
- Easier to collaborate

---

### Question 5: How much time can you invest upfront?

**Minimal - need results fast**
→ Option 1 (Separate repos)
- 2-3 hours per app
- Start seeing value immediately
- No large upfront investment

**Moderate - willing to invest for future savings**
→ Option 2 (Monorepo)
- 8-12 hours initial setup
- Pays off after 4-5 apps
- Good middle ground

**Significant - strategic long-term investment**
→ Option 3 (Template framework)
- 20-30 hours to build framework
